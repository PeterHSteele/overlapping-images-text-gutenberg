Gutenberg block showing overlapping image and text content.

== Description ==

Creates a section of content consisting of one or two images decoratively overlapping each other and accompanied by 
a card for text content like headings, paragraphs and call to action buttons. The block accomodates normal, wide, and full-page
width layouts. You can arrange the block's three elements (two images and one text), in four different sub-layouts. This allows for
better re-usability in different areas of your site.


== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
